# Input with date format support
Recently Iâ€™ve received a test task where I needed to implement a text input with the ability to convert a valid text to a date and then work with it

I searched all over the internet but didn't find a similar solution, so I'll post it for others just in case. Could be useful for someone :)

The algorithm is as follows:
1. Find out the position of the cursor\
2. If the input is a valid date form, then\
3. if the cursor is in the form area (day, month, year, etc.), then\
4. Select this form area and change

There are two ways in my solution to change the date:
1) Cyclically.
Rotate the date within the selection area (Example: December 31, 2021 -> December 1, 2021)
2) Non-cyclical.
Rotate the date within the whole date (For example: December 31, 2021 -> January 1, 2022)
